# Introduction

This document provides an overview and explanation of the functionality and structure of the RMD scripts used in the project. Each section corresponds to a specific RMD file and describes its purpose, main features, and implementation details.

# RMD Scripts Overview

## Script: `NetRapp.Rmd`

### Purpose
This script implements an interactive Shiny application for visualizing and analyzing network data derived from WGCNA analysis.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Network Visualization**:
  - Allows users to explore module-specific networks with customizable thresholds.
  - Supports Cytoscape file generation for further exploration.

- **User Inputs**:
  - Slider to adjust correlation threshold (`cor`).
  - Module selection using checkbox inputs (`variables`).
  - Enrichment analysis options such as GO and KEGG.

- **Outputs**:
  - Network plots visualizing connections between genes within selected modules.
  - Exportable Cytoscape files for advanced visualization.

### Structure
1. **Sidebar**:
   - UI components for user interaction.
2. **Network Visualization**:
   - Dynamically generates and displays the network based on user inputs.
3. **Enrichment Analysis**:
   - Facilitates pathway and GO analysis of selected modules.

## Script: `WGCNA_v3.Rmd`

### Purpose
This script focuses on constructing and analyzing weighted gene co-expression networks (WGCNA).

### Key Features
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Processes input expression data to filter low-expression genes.
  
- **Network Construction**:
  - Uses soft-thresholding to define adjacency and TOM matrices.

- **Module Detection**:
  - Identifies modules of co-expressed genes using hierarchical clustering.

- **Trait Association**:
  - Relates module eigengenes to external traits.

### Structure
1. **Data Input and Cleaning**:
   - Loads and preprocesses expression data.
2. **Network Construction**:
   - Computes adjacency and TOM matrices.
3. **Module Detection**:
   - Identifies gene modules and assigns colors.
4. **Trait Association**:
   - Correlates module eigengenes with clinical traits.

# How to Use These Scripts

1. **Execution**:
   - Each RMD file can be run independently in RStudio to generate its respective outputs.
   - Ensure all required packages (e.g., `WGCNA`, `igraph`, `shiny`) are installed.

2. **Interactivity**:
   - The Shiny application (`NetRapp.Rmd`) requires an active R session to display interactive elements.

3. **Integration**:
   - The outputs of `WGCNA_v3.Rmd` can be used as inputs for `NetRapp.Rmd`.

# Conclusion
This document summarizes the purpose and functionality of the RMD scripts. It serves as a guide for understanding how to use and integrate these scripts into the analysis pipeline. For more details, refer to the code comments and inline documentation within each script.
